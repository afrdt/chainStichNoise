# chainStitchNoise

ChainStitch Noise is an embroidered synthesizer using an ATtiny microcontroller and two capacitive sensing pads to control a white noise generator (pseudo-random number generator) and its random grain repetition.

It forms part of a series of embroidered synthesizers that I use in a sound performance entitled Lilytronica. The intrinsic aspect of this work is the contradiction created between the “soft” interfaces of the embroidered instruments and the loud and immersive soundscape that they produce.
